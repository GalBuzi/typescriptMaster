# Node.js TS 
## ESM starter kit

This simple setup is compiles Typescript to Node.js ESM.

It is indeed experimental and can change at any time.
Be sure to use .js extension name at the end of your import statements of your own source files.

You can add these two lines to VSCode to add .js extentions for you on auto-imports...

```
"javascript.preferences.importModuleSpecifierEnding": "js"
"typescript.preferences.importModuleSpecifierEnding": "js"
```

An easier alternative you may consider is to simply dompile everything to commonjs.
